# FPGA Learning

This repo is purposed to contain all the VHDL code produces during the electronics lab's week
for the FPGA section, from 2020/12/07 to 12/11 included.

This is basically beginners code, reflecting my learnings of (V)HDL and FPGA programming.

Exercices 1 and 2 are using **schematic capture** to compile a `.bit` file.

Exercices 3 to 6 are using **VHDL**.
